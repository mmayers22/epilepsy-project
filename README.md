An in-progress study of epilepsy comorbidities based on self-reported data from PatientsLikeMe


## Overview
This is my capstone project for my senior year at Auburn University, and it involves a study of comorbidities in epilepsy patients on the opopular website PatientsLikeMe. Epilepsy is an issue close to my heart, as I have a family member who was diagnosed in 2021. The goal of this project is to look at what other diseases are commonly coinciding with epilepsy, in order to further understand the causes and effects of epilepsy and the associated medications.

## What is Epilepsy?
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in the brain that causes seizures, and it can be associated with several different triggers. Some of these triggers can include flashing lights, dehydration, lack of sleep, or hyperactivity. Most epilepsy patients are diagnosed before they turn 25, and many of them do not have another seizure after going on medication. However, many patients do not respond to medication and continue to have seizures throughout their lives. 

## Dataset
The dataset of epilepsy patients contains 10434 patients and was gathered from PatientsLikeMe, a popular website that holds forums for patients with similar diagnoses to discuss. The dataset contains patient age, state, gender, age of diagnosis, and secondary conditions. The average age of diagnosis for patients is 22 years old, with 7122 females and 3241 males.
